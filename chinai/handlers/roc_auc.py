class ROCAUC(Metric):
    """Computes Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC).
    accumulating predictions and the ground-truth during an epoch and applying `compute_roc_auc`.

    Args:
        to_onehot_y (bool): whether to convert `y` into the one-hot format. Defaults to False.
        add_softmax (bool): whether to add softmax function to `y_pred` before computation. Defaults to False.
        average (`macro|weighted|micro|None`): type of averaging performed if not binary classification. default is 'macro'.

            - 'macro': calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted mean.
              this does not take label imbalance into account.
            - 'weighted': calculate metrics for each label, and find their average,
              weighted by support (the number of true instances for each label).
            - 'micro': calculate metrics globally by considering each element of the label
              indicator matrix as a label.
            - None: the scores for each class are returned.

        output_transform (callable, optional): a callable that is used to transform the
            :class:`~ignite.engine.Engine` `process_function` output into the
            form expected by the metric. This can be useful if, for example, you have a multi-output model and
            you want to compute the metric with respect to one of the outputs.

    Note:
        ROCAUC expects y to be comprised of 0's and 1's.  y_pred must either be probability estimates or confidence values.
